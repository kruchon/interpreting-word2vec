= Interpreting Word2vec/GloVe word embeddings

In this repository I attempt to reproduce the findings of a paper written by Thomas A. Trost and Dietrich Klakow titled http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W17/W17-2404.pdf[Parameter Free Hierarchical Graph-Based Clustering for Analyzing
Continuous Word Embeddings^].

I use scikit-learn, Neo4j, and the Neo4j graph algorithms and APOC libraries.

== Installation

* Download the Neo4j Desktop from https://neo4j.com/download[neo4j.com/download^]
* Install the APOC and Graph Algorithms libraries
